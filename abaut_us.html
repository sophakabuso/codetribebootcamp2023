            Our Story</h1>
            <p style="height:20vh;background-color: silver;padding-top: 0%;" >
              It all started in 1982 when I got to know how advanced Technology is around the
              world when it comes to Agriculture, Manufacturing, Mining, Education, etc.
              Certain countries experience extreme bad weather conditions for more or less
              than a year but still manage to produce enough food for the nation and for export
              as well.
              Coming from Africa where Technology is not fully utilised to empower people
              economically and otherwise, MANEX(PTY LTD) was established specifically to
              facilitate the use of advancing technologies in various spheres of our economy.
              MANEX(PTY LTD) considers itself as a bridge that connects Investors and the
              Market for sustainable development and economic growth. We believe in
              inclusive and sustainable industries to bring about prosperity.
