        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        
        <p id="paragraph1" > My name is <em>Sophakama</em> Buso I was born on the<em> 2 nd of September 1985</em>, originally I’m from
          the
          strikingly beautiful green landscapes of <em>eGcuwa</em> in the <em>Eastern Cape</em>, now I am residing in
          the
          historical township of <em>Soweto</em> in <em>Johannesburg</em>, since 2010. I reflect a varied personality
          including
          ambition, and the qualities of generosity and thoughtfulness. I am also definite and purposeful, well
          determined and vigorous individual, yet pleasantly calm. I encourage fighting for what you desire
          and believe in, and doing it through the wisdom of all those who came before us, that is our
          Ancestors because nothing great comes easy and with God everything is possible.</p>
        <p> In 2004 I studied for Bsc(Computer Science and Physics) at UNITRA now Walter Sisulu
          University in Mthatha due to unforeseen events related to my heath I was unable to finish 1 st year.
          In 2008 Eskom offered me a bursary to study Beng(Electrical Engineering) at the University of
          Pretoria which I studied for two years before circumstances related to my health forced my studies
          to be terminated. Motivated by my love for learning in 2017 I registered for BSc( Computer Science
          Applied Mathematics) with UNISA which I’m still currently studying and on my 2 nd year, in 2018 I
          registered for Higher Certificate in Total Quality Management with UNISA which I completed in
          2019</p>
        <p> 2004 up-to-date I have worked in various industries from Banking and Financial Services,
          Manufacturing, Engineering, Retail, Sales etc.,I have also been involved in numerous community
          activities from various structures Political, Recreation, Religious, Business and Policing forums
          taking numerous leadership positions.</p>
        <p>As I strive to become an outstanding and successful individual in today’s society and through my
          passion for Science and Technology and love for Humanity I have embraced a fanatical interest on
          how to better utilise advancing technologies and innovations in order to transform our economies to
          be inclusive, and eliminate Poverty in our country and the continent. Over the years I have
          accumulated vast knowledge and wisdom, which gave me certain set of qualities including
          Analytical, decisive, detailed, Goal oriented, organised, entrepreneurial, tech-savy, team player and
          innovator.</p>
        <P>Apart from the above I have, kept keen interest in cosmology and programming and I enjoy doing
          research on key concepts and strategies that can be utilised to bring about prosperity and eliminate
          poverty amongst our society, and most importantly I enjoy spending time with my loved ones.</P>
